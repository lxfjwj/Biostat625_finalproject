preprocess methods: 
#Imputation_method:
#1:Imputing mean
#2:Imputing draw (as there are some categorical data)
#3:Imputation using random forest   (extremely slow, unweighted, but quite recommended in literature)
#4:MICE(Multivariate Imputation via Chained Equations) (preassuming MAR) (slow, unweighted but recommended)
#E-M Imputation cannot be used(preassuming MAR and multivariate normal)
#iterative knn algorithm too slow
#Literature said there is no available efficient imputation algorithm taken weight into consideration, and that there's no evidence against imputing without weight 

#Feature_selection: Algorithm used in third feature selection/dimension reduction
#0 Read in existed selection output
#1 Using SVD and select variables contributing most to eigenvectors with high eigenvalues
#2 Use random forest predictor on imputed data (a bit slow)(no weighted version of random forest, just include weight as a variable and do selection)
#3 Lasso (not using threshold, gives own feature selection)

example: imputation 2, feature selection 3: 2-3


model_summary 
rmse/error of each model (default label = status of all vaccine) 

row 2-6: use the data 2019+2020, different data preprocess methods (2-1, 2-3, etc), the rmse calculated by 5-fold cv. 2-3 has the lowest rmse.
  
row 10: use data 2019 as train data, treat with 2-3, use data 2020 as test data, treat with 2-0, to gain the same features with 2019. shows rmse on train data and test data

row 11: use data 2019+2020, label = flu1 (SHTFLU12M_A) as train data, data 2019+2020, label = flu2 (SHTPNUEV_A) as test data, shows error (classifier) on train data and test data.
